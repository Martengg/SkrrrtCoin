# SkrrrtCoin - Mining

## How the mining works

1. fetch the needed data ( mining-job uuid and the nonce to mine ) from the api-endpoint


2. crack the nonce with a md5 hash (if you want to know more exactly how it works look at
   the example mining-scripts)


3. post the solution to the api-endpoint


## Run the scripts

If you don't want to code a script for yourself you can just copy the code from the
server directory in your favourite language ( if the script exists in this language ).

BUT before you start the mining, please make sure to have a registered account on the
SkrrrtCoin Website and you have changed the public-key variable in the code to your own
public-key ( If you forgot your public-key, your private-key or 
your username, please create a new account and store these important values )

Then simply run the script ( run it how you would normally run a script in this language ).

Good Luck and Enjoy :)

## Improve your script/s

If you want to get one of the big players among the SkrrrtMiners I recommend improving the
script, because especially our example scripts are intentionally not  optimized at all.

It is also a good idea ( if your PC/Server can handle it ) to run multiple scripts at the
same time and even, if you have a good processor and graphics card you could run scripts
in different languages, for example one script uses mainly or completely the CPU and
the other programming language does the same with the GPU. Then you can get even more
performance out of your PC/Server.

You could also overclock your components, but then they maybe don't least as long as
normally.
