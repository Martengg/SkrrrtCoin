# SkrrrtCoin - Coin
___

The SkrrrtCoin is not a real crypto coin, but it is very close to one. The coin is not
decentralized and has a blockchain, but the blocks for this chain are not build during
the mining. The mining process is only for verifying a block and that there aren't any
fake transactions.

Also please don't use it as a serious currency, because it is not meant to be one. It is
more likely a little fun project under devs who can build the fastest script to mine as
much as he can with his hardware and also, yeah like every crypto coin (or every kinda 
crypto coin), who has the fastest, the most efficient and the most PCs/Servers/GPUs/CPUs
running the mining scripts and who runs the most at the same time and how often and long
and so on...

By the way I don't give you money for these coins... but if you find someone who gives
you money or other things for these coins then you could technically trade these coins.

So I hope you enjoy my little project, I know it is not perfect, but it is not meant to
be perfect, it is meant to be funny :)
